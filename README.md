# Android Base Project
My version of a barebone project to quickly start developing new apps

## Setup
Dependencies and versions are grouped in the buildSrc folder in the Dependency.kt and Version.kt files

The project includes already these following library configured:

* Dagger 2 (+ Dagger Android)
* Retrofit + Gson + OkHttp
* Room DataBase
* Gradle Versions Plugin by Ben Manes to check dependency updates (since standard lint doesn't work with the buildSrc setup)
* RxJava + RxAndroid

More libraries alredy defined and ready to use
